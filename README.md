Entry for Mini Ludum Dare - 59

Based off the Boids model for flocking behaviour.

Kill enemies and gather coins to increase score, choose from random sprite sheets each game (pulled from http://swapshop.pixelsyntax.com/api/randomImage).

Swap your current position with any of the randomly placed blocks to help move around the arena and avoid the swarm. 

Use your (limited) special ability to break the swarm and escape, recharge by collecting pickups.

Controls
Movement: WASD
Aiming: Mouse
Fire: Left Mouse Button
Swap Player w/ Block: Right Mouse Button when cursor is over block
Scare Swarm: Hold Spacebar (uses magic, cannot shoot)

Start Game: Z
Swap Spritesheet: R (try before starting game)

Health is displayed top left, when hit player swaps places with random block

Magic charges displayed top right, refill from pickups

Total score displayed top center, increase by killing enemies and gather coins
No limit on block swaps, so use if you get stuck due to random block placement!

After spawning or being hit enemies will flee until you start attacking

To play download from either github or dropbox (still uploading) and run MLD59.exe

Let me know of any bugs or issues.

Thanks.
